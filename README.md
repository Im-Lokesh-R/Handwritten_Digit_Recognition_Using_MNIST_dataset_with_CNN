Handwritten Digit Recognition â€“ Using MNIST dataset with CNN (TensorFlow/Keras)

"
This project involves recognizing handwritten digits (0-9) from images, using a dataset called MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology). This dataset consists of thousands of handwritten digit images, and the goal is to classify these images accurately using machine learning techniques.

In this case, im using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to achieve this classification task, leveraging TensorFlow and Keras, which are powerful tools for building and training deep learning models.
